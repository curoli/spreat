Rules

Board game where two (or more) players place atoms on hexagons until these 
explode and distribute atoms around, causing chain reactions.

The board consists of hexagons arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Players take 
turns. During each turn, a player places a new atom they own on a 
hexagon that is either empty or occupied by the player's own atoms. 

As soon as a hexagon acquires at least as many atoms as it has nearest 
neighbours, it explodes and one atom is distributed to each neighbour while 
turning any atoms already on these neighbours into atoms of the player who 
triggered the explosion. 

An explosion can cause neighours to immediately explode, too, and trigger a 
chain reaction.

The goal is to turn all other players' atoms into your own.

History

This game has been modeled after two games I encountered years ago, both 
being played on a checkerboard.

The first was called Sprengmeister (German for "demolition master") running 
on an Atari ST. In Sprengmeister, explosions happened one at a time, so 
a symmetric distribution of atoms may become unsymmetric during explosions.

The second was called Atomic, and I don't remember whether it was on Atari ST 
or Intel x86. I also don't remember whether it handeled explosions 
consecutively or concurrently, but I do remember that it had some bugs 
and crashed on occasion.
