Board game where two (or more) players place atoms on hexagons until these explode and distribute atoms around, causing chain reactions.

The board consists of hexagons arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Players take turns. During each turn, a player places one of the player's atom on a hexagon that is either empty or occupied by the player's atoms. 

As soon as a hexagon acquires at least as many atoms as it has nearest neighbours, it explodes and one atom is distributed to each neighbour while turning any atoms already on these neighbours into atoms of the player who triggered the explosion. 

An explosion can cause neighours to immediately explode, too, and trigger a chain reaction.

The goal is to turn all other players' atoms into your own.
